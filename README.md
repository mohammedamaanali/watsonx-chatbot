# 🤖 Watsonx Chatbot (No-Code) — IBM Cloud Internship Project

This repository contains the implementation of a no-code chatbot developed using **IBM Watsonx Assistant**, created as part of my internship under the **AICTE Edunet Foundation Program in collaboration with IBM Cloud and IBM SkillsBuild**. The solution demonstrates how enterprise-grade AI assistants can be built using visual tools—without writing a single line of backend code.

By integrating **Watsonx.ai foundation models** through **Prompt Lab**, the chatbot is capable of understanding and responding to user inputs with greater contextual intelligence and natural language capabilities.

## 🧑‍🎓 Internship Context

This chatbot project was developed during my 4-week virtual internship at **IBM Cloud**, where I explored emerging technologies in **AI and Cloud Computing**. My objective was to evaluate how IBM Watsonx tools—especially no-code frameworks—can accelerate the development of real-world AI solutions, even for those with minimal coding background.
